# Checklist

1. Set up new Gmail for WLUA (✓) and **provide login credentials**.  I will use this information to sync email/drive with forms, calendar, and other public information
2. Purchase domain name of your choice (✓) and **provide login credentials**.  I will use this information to deploy the site.
3. **Schools we support logos**: Send separate from the document if possible.
4. **Spotlight Photos** Send separate from green background if possible.
5. All questions for forms and remaining content

# Ideas 

1. **Image quality**: Even at their original size, the images are blurry.  I can try to incorporate them in a different way but I would recommend using other images if possible.
2. Combine [`Rules & Resources`](/resources) and [`Youth`](/youth) into one page.
