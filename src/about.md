The Washington Lacrosse Umpires Association (WLUA) is a professional, nonprofit organization of girls' high school and youth lacrosse officials in the Washington, D.C. Metro area.  Our organization is affiliated with USA Lacrosse, the national governing body for the sport.  Established in the early 1980s, WLUA recruits, develops, trains, rates and assigns officials.  We cover games for schools, clubs, conferences and leagues, both indoor and outdoor, throughout the year.  All members are expected to participate in continuing lacrosse-specific education and training that helps them to understand and interpret new rules.
